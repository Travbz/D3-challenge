          <h2>Price correlation of ETH against Bitcoin 10-12-2020 to 2-27-2021</h2>
          <p>    Apart from a few outlier altcoins, top cryptocurrencies are very closely correlated with Bitcoin; as a 
            result, the idea of diversifying your crypto portfolio to spread risk is a little "bit" of an illusion.  One of
            the most misleading labels in the cryptocurrency markets is the idea of Bitcoin dominance, which is represented
            as Bitcoin’s percentage occupancy of the entire market cap of cryptocurrencies.  </p>

          <p>    Bitcoin Dominance is calculated as: Total Market Cap/BTC Market Capitalization = BTC Dominance. Bitcoin's 
            dominance really digs deeper into the cryptoverse, any leveraged crypto trader can attest to this from watching their stop losses
            get triggered as a violent Bitcoin move causes a cascading liquidation event across the crypto markets.</p>

          <p>    Normally when comparing the correlation between two items, any number between 0.7 to 1.0 indicates a strong positive
            correlation; in other words, between those two numbers, it’s a really strong likelihood that you have a powerful 
            relationship between the two.. The correlation comparisons i ran between Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETH), Cardano(ADA), Chainlink(LINK),
            and Dogecoin(DOGE) showed very strong correlations with BTC prices between 10/12/20202 and 2-27-2021BTC. BTC and ETH was 0.97 from this
            selected time period, BTC and LINK was 0.89, BTC/ADA at 0.9, BTC/DOGE at 0.81, and AAVE/BTC at 0.87, respectively.</p>

          <p>   With such a strong relationship we can deduce that when BTC moves, altcoins follow. To be fair, this data is all that was available
            to me for free. To better understand BTC price correlation i would want to sample a larger dataset that included bear
            market price action for the top 100 cryptos by market capitalization.. This data is clearly a sample taken during bull market
            price action so i its unclear if outliers may have uncoupled from BTC and experienced price action free of BTC influence.
            It would also be interesting to use ETH as a Y axis and plot all #defi smart contracts built on the erc-20 token within
            ETH's own ecosystem, on the X axis. I suspect the results would look similar to this.</p>

          <p>   Im not saying there is less upside in other coin markets im just trying to show that the concept of spreading risk through 
            diversifcation in this market may need further tuning. Surely there is tremendous upside (as we have seen) in many non-BTC cryptos,
            but correlation patterns show there isnt any less risk in holding other coins. I cant back up this next statement, but from my 
            experience, i have observed that Bitcoin price drops cause more serious drops in altcoins. As someone that uses ETH weekly i now realize
            that i may need to consider BTC more criticlly when it comes to my capital preservation strategy for my ETH position(s).
          </p>
          <p>The data was obtained from  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory">kaggle.com</a> and was modified with 
            python in a jupyter notebook. All the statistical analysis was also conducted in python.
